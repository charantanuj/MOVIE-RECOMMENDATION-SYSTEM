Movie Recommendation system recommends movies for its users to watch, based on their film preferences using collaborative filtering. Recommender systems are information filtering tools that aspire to predict the rating for users and items, predominantly from big data to recommend their likes. Movie recommendation systems provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying users with similar interests. This makes recommender systems essentially a central part of websites and e-commerce applications. Data taken from Group lens site and contain 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies. tools we used Spark and Python - PySpark, ALS, Regression Evaluator. we have used Apache Spark ML, alternating least squares (ALS) for collaborative filtering for making recommendations. Alternating least square (ALS) matrix factorization basically take a large (or potentially huge) matrix and factor it into some smaller representation of the original matrix through alternating least squares. We end up with two or more lower dimensional matrices whose product equals the original one. ALS comes inbuilt in Apache Spark. The idea behind the project is to improve customer's experience through personalized recommendations based on prior user feedback.
